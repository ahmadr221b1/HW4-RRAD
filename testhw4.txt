"Marvin's Room"

"Hello
Yeah, I just walked in
Yeah, I'm good you still working?
Tonight, right now?
Did I go out? Yeah, I went out
I went, I went to a couple of clubs
I never went to bed
Shit... wine or water
You should see someone about a cold drink
I don't know, I'm delirious... night."

Cups of the Ros√©
Bitches in my old phone
I should call one and go home
I've been in this club too long
The woman that I would try
Is happy with a good guy

But I've been drinking so much
That I'mma call her anyway and say
"Fuck that nigga that you love so bad
I know you still think about the times we had."
I say, "Fuck that nigga that you think you found
And since you picked up I know he's not around."
